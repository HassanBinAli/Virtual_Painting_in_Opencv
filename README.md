# Virtual_Painting_in_Opencv
This project is written in opencv library. 
In this, the front camera of the laptop is used to detect some colors (orange, blue, green, purple) in front of the laptop screen. 
Then makes a line following the movement of that colored object. 
The line drawn is of the same color as the object.
